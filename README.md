**DataStructres**
-------------
How data is organized, stored, and manipulated within a program.

**DataTypes**
-------------

### Types of DataStructres
   * 1-Linear Data Structure 
     * Static Data Structure 
       *   array
     * Dynamic Data Structure
       *    Queue, Stack,LikedList
   * 2-Non-Linear Data Structure
       * Trees and Graphs. 

##### **Everything in python is an object**
##### **Every python object carry(type - refcount - value)**
* # **Objects** 
  * Simple (Numbers - Strings)
    
     * Store thier own value
     * Stored in memory once
       
   * Container (Dicts - Lists - User defined Classes)

   * # **Memory Mangement**

 *  **Reference** Count

   * # **Garbage Collection**
   
   Automatically release memory when the object takingup that space is no longer in use
    
      
  * # **Arrays**
---------------------
Array is not builtin python datastructure but we can implement it by array module     
In Python, WE donâ€™t typically work with arrays, but with lists. 
There are libraries to work with arrays, but you only use them for certain specialized purposes. 
Such as when you need matrix multiplication or some other advanced math, and want to do it quickly.


## Access data by index(Memory):
    array base address+single value stores count * index
    single value stores count = number of array elements
## Arrays Types:
  * Simple Array
  * Two dimensional Array 
  * Multi dimensional Array

## To work with Arrays in python:
  *  Import array module
  *  Declare your variable with Typecode //>> variable_name = array(typecode,[elements])

**OR Import `numpy`
     It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), 
     and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, 
     shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, 
     random simulation and much more.**
